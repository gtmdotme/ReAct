r0,s3,Quality ====== The approach seems sound but the paper does not provide many details on the underlying approach.,actionable,shortcoming
r0,s4,The application to learning from (partially adversarial) demonstrations is a cool idea but effectively is a very straightforward application based on the insight that the approach can handle truly off-policy samples.,non_actionable,fact

r1,s1,"Others: - The baseline in REINFORCE (Williams'92), which is equivalent to introduced Lagrange multiplier, is well known and well defined as control variate in Monte Carlo simulation, certainly not an ""ad-hoc heuristic"" as claimed in the paper [see Greensmith et al. (2004). Variance Reduction for Gradient Estimates in Reinforcement Learning, JMLR 5.] - Bandit to supervised conversion: please add a supervised baseline system trained just on instances with top feedbacks -- this should be a much more interesting and relevant strong baseline.",actionable,suggestion

r1,s6,- The claim of Theorem 2 in appendix B does not follow from its proof: what is proven is that the value of S(w) lies in an interval [1-e..1+e] with a certain probability for all w.,actionable,shortcoming

r10,s0,The paper presents a new technique for anomaly detection where the dimension reduction and the density estimation steps are jointly optimized.,non_actionable,fact
r10,s1,I'm also not convinced of how well the Gaussian model fits the low-dimensional representation and how well can a neural network compute the GMM mixture memberships.,non_actionable,shortcoming
r10,s2,"1. The framework uses the class information, i.e., “only data samples from the normal class are used for training”, but it is still considered unsupervised.",non_actionable,shortcoming
r10,s3,"Also, the anomaly detection in the evaluation step is based on a threshold which depends on the percentage of known anomalies, i.e., a priori information.",non_actionable,fact
r10,s4,"Better yet it would be to use methods like Local Outlier Factor (LOF) (Breunig et al., 2000 – LOF:Identifying Density-based local outliers) to detect the outliers (these methods also have parameters to tune, sure, but using the known percentage of anomalies to find the threshold is not relevant in a purely unsupervised context when we don't know how many anomalies are in the data).",actionable,suggestion
r10,s5,Do you normalize the features (the output of the dimension reduction and the representation error are quite different)?,actionable,question
r10,s6,Fig. 3a doesn't seem to show that the output is a clear mixture of Gaussians.,actionable,shortcoming

r10,s8,They are the best in terms of precision.,non_actionable,fact
r10,s9,"Clarity – The paper is very well written with clear statements, a pleasure to read.",non_actionable,agreement
r100,s0,An interesting paper which is marginally above acceptance threshold The authors of the paper propose a framework to generate natural adversarial examples by searching adversaries in a latent space of dense and continuous data representation (instead of in the original input data space).,non_actionable,agreement
r100,s1,"The details of their proposed method are covered in Algorithm 1 on Page 12, where an additional GAN (generative adversarial network) I_{\gamma}, which can be regarded as the inverse function of the original GAN G_{\theta}, is trained to learn a map from the original input data space to the latent z-space.",non_actionable,fact
r100,s2,The intuition of the proposed approach is clearly explained and it seems very reasonable to me.,non_actionable,agreement
r100,s3,"My main concern, however, is in the current sampling-based search algorithm in the latent z-space, which the authors have already admitted in the paper.",non_actionable,shortcoming
r100,s4,The efficiency of such a search method decreases very fast when the dimensions of the z-space increases.,non_actionable,fact
r100,s5,Another concern is that the authors have not provided sufficient number of examples to show the advantages of their proposed method over the other method (such as FGSM) in generating the adversaries.,actionable,shortcoming
r100,s6,Could you explicitly specify the dimension of the latent z-space in each example in image and text domain in Section 3?,actionable,question

r100,s8,Could you still say that your generated “adversaries” leading to the wrong decision from LeNet?,actionable,question
r100,s9,How do you choose the parameter \lambda in Equation (2)?,actionable,question
r101,s0,"In this work, the authors suggest the use of control variate schemes for estimating gradient values, within a reinforcement learning  framework.",non_actionable,fact
r101,s1,The authors also introduce a specific control variate technique based on the so-called Stein’s identity.,non_actionable,fact
r101,s2,The paper is interesting and well-written.,non_actionable,agreement

r102,s3,"Indeed, the authors have commented: ""AlexNet with batch-normalization (AlexNet-BN) is the standard model ... acceptance that improvements made to accuracy transfer well to more modern architectures.""",non_actionable,fact
r102,s4,3. The paper wants to find a good trade-off on speed and accuracy.,non_actionable,fact
r102,s5,"The authors have plotted such trade-off on space v.s. accuracy in Figure 3(b), then how about speed v.s. accuracy?",actionable,question
r102,s6,My concern is that one-bit system is already complicated to implement.,non_actionable,shortcoming
r102,s7,"Indeed, the authors have discussed their implementation in Section 3.3, so, how their method works in practice?",actionable,question
r102,s8,4. Is trade-off between 1 to 2 bits really important?,actionable,question

r103,s0,Recognizing and Updating NE Embeddings on the Fly The paper proposes to generate embedding of named-entities on the fly during dialogue sessions.,non_actionable,fact
r103,s1,"If the text is from the user, a named entity recognizer is used.",non_actionable,fact
r103,s2,"If it is from the bot response, then it is known which words are named entities therefore embedding can be constructed directly.",non_actionable,fact
r103,s3,The idea has some novelty and the results on several tasks attempting to prove its effectiveness against systems that handle named entities in a static way.,non_actionable,fact
r103,s4,One thing I hope the author could provide more clarification is the use of NER.,actionable,suggestion
r103,s5,"To my understanding, because of the presence of the NER in the With-NE-Table model, you could directly do update to the NE embeddings and query from the DB using a combination of embedding and the NE words (as the paper does), whereas the W/O-NE-Table model cannot because of lack of the NER.",non_actionable,fact
r103,s6,"This seems to prove that an NER is useful for tasks where DB queries are needed, rather than that the dynamic NE-Table construction is useful.",non_actionable,fact
r103,s7,"You could use an NER for W/O-NE-Table and update the NE embeddings, and it should be as good as With-NE-Table model (and fairer to compare with too).",actionable,suggestion
r103,s8,"That said, overall the paper is a nice contribution to dialogue and QA system research by pointing out a simple way of handling named entities by dynamically updating their embeddings.",non_actionable,agreement
r103,s9,"It would be better if the paper could point out the importance of NER for user utterances, and the fact that using the knowledge of which words are NEs in dialogue models could help in tasks where DB queries are necessary.",actionable,suggestion
r104,s0,"Standard idea, great results This paper borrows the classic idea of spectral regularization, recently applied to deep learning by Yoshida and Miyato (2017) and use it to normalize GAN objectives.",non_actionable,agreement
r104,s1,This Lipschitz property has already been proposed by recent methods and has showed some success.,non_actionable,fact
r104,s2,"However,  the authors here argue that spectral normalization is more powerful; it allows for models of higher rank (more non-zero singular values) which implies a more powerful discriminator and eventually more accurate generator.",non_actionable,fact
r104,s3,This is demonstrated in comparison to weight normalization in Figure 4.,non_actionable,fact
r104,s4,The experimental results are very good and give strong support for the proposed normalization.,non_actionable,agreement
r104,s5,"The paper is overall well written (though check Comment 3 below), it covers the related work well and it includes an insightful discussion about the importance of high rank models.",non_actionable,agreement
r104,s6,"I am recommending acceptance, though I anticipate to see a more rounded evaluation of the exact mechanism under which SN improves over the state of the art.",non_actionable,agreement
r104,s7,"I found the discussion about rank to be very intuitive, however this intuition is not fully tested.",actionable,shortcoming
r104,s8,I would like to see the same spectra included.,actionable,suggestion
r104,s9,Do you get comparable inception scores?,actionable,question
r105,s0,It then argues that speeding up the activation function may be important since the convolution operations in CNNs are becoming heavily optimized and may form a lesser fraction of the overall computation.,non_actionable,fact
r105,s1,The ISRLU is then reported to be 2.6x faster compared to ELU using AVX2 instructions.,non_actionable,fact
r105,s2,Preliminary experimental results are reported which demonstrate that ISRLU can perform similar to ELU.,non_actionable,fact
r105,s3,"However, on one hand the contribution is rather narrow, and on the other the results presented do not clearly show that the contribution is of significance in practice.",actionable,shortcoming
r105,s4,b) and what is the percentage of cycles saved by employing the ISRLU.,actionable,question
r105,s5,"The presented results using small networks on the MNIST dataset only show that networks with ISRLU can perform similar to those with other activation functions, but not the speed advantages of ISRLU.",actionable,shortcoming
r105,s6,The effect of using the faster approximation on performance also remains to be investigated.,actionable,shortcoming
r105,s7,Clarity: The content of the paper is unclear in certain areas.,actionable,shortcoming
r105,s8,- It is not clear what Table 2 is showing.,actionable,shortcoming
r105,s9,- Why is the final Cross-Entropy Loss so high even though the accuracy is >99% for the MNIST experiments?,actionable,question
r106,s0,Review (Summary) This paper is about learning discriminative features for the target domain in unsupervised DA problem.,non_actionable,fact
r106,s1,The key idea is to use a critic which randomly drops the activations in the logit and maximizes the sensitivity between two versions of discriminators.,non_actionable,fact
r106,s2,The approach proposed in section 3.2 uses dropout logits and the sensitivity criterion between two softmax probability distributions which seems novel.,non_actionable,fact

r106,s4,Does the proposed method outperform these state of the art methods using the same network architectures?,actionable,question

r106,s7,"The text says ""(ENT) obtained by modifying (Springenberg 2015)"".",non_actionable,fact
r106,s8,I'd encourage the authors to make this part more explicit and self-explanatory.,actionable,suggestion
r106,s9,The method section is not very well written and the authors avoid comparing the method against the state of the art methods in unsupervised DA.,actionable,shortcoming
r107,s0,"Given the recent interest in (deep) reinforcement learning (combined with the lack of theoretical guarantees in this space), this is a very timely problem to study.",non_actionable,agreement
r107,s1,The proposed approach leverages recent work that gives a novel parametrization of control problems in the LDS setting.,non_actionable,fact
r107,s2,The time and sample complexities of this approach are polynomial in all relevant parameters.,non_actionable,fact
r107,s3,The authors also highlight that their sample complexity depends only logarithmically on the time horizon T. The paper focuses on the theoretical results and does not present experiments (the polynomials are also not elaborated further).,actionable,shortcoming
r107,s4,"However, I am not sure if the paper is a good fit for ICLR since it is purely theoretical in nature and has no experiments.",non_actionable,shortcoming
r107,s5,It would be helpful if the authors could comment on the dependence between T and L. (B) Why does the bound in Theorem 2.4 become worse when there are some directions that do not contribute to the cost (the lambda dependence)?,actionable,suggestion
r107,s6,It would enhance readability of the paper if the results were more self-contained.,actionable,suggestion

r107,s9,"I assume that it involves \hat{M}, but it would be good to formally define this notation.",actionable,suggestion
r108,s0,"In this paper, the authors propose deep architecture that preserves mutual information between the input and the hidden representation and show that the loss of information can only occur at the final layer.",non_actionable,fact
r108,s1,They illustrate empirically that the loss of information can be avoided on large-scale classification such as ImageNet and propose to build an invertible deep network that is capable of retaining the information of the input signal through all the layers of the network until the last layer where the input could be reconstructed.,non_actionable,fact
r108,s2,"As it requires a special care to design an invertible architecture, the authors architecture is based on the recent reversible residual network (RevNet) introduced in (Gomez et al., 2017) and an invertible down-sampling operator introduced in (Shi et al., 2016).",non_actionable,fact
r108,s3,The obtained result is competitive with the original Resnet and the RevNet models.,non_actionable,fact
r108,s4,"Still, the classification and the reconstructing results are quite impressive as the work is the first empirical evidence that learning invertible representation that preserves information about the input is possible on large-scale classification tasks.",non_actionable,agreement
r108,s5,The submitted paper shows that this principle is not a necessary condition large-scale classification.,non_actionable,fact
r108,s6,It is also simple and easy to understand.,non_actionable,agreement
r108,s7,The spectral analysis of the differential operator in section 4.1 provide another motivation for the “hard-constrained” invertible architecture.,non_actionable,fact
r108,s8,"Section 5 shows that even when using either an SVM or a Nearest Neighbor classifier on n extracted features from a layer in the network, both classifiers progressively improve with deeper layers.",non_actionable,fact
r108,s9,"Indeed, the authors have succeed in showing that this is not necessarily the case.",non_actionable,agreement
r109,s0,"In particular, when node2vec has its restart probability set pretty high, the random walks tend to stay within the local neighborhood (near the starting node).",non_actionable,fact
r109,s1,The main difference is in the sentence construction strategy.,non_actionable,fact
r109,s2,"Whereas node2vec may sample walks that have context windows containing the same node, the proposed method does not as it uses a random permutation of a node's neighbors.",non_actionable,fact
r109,s3,This is the main difference between the proposed method and node2vec/DeepWalk.,non_actionable,fact
r109,s4,Proposes a simple yet effective way to sample walks from large graphs.,non_actionable,agreement
r109,s5,Cons: The description on the experimental setup seems to lack some important details.,actionable,shortcoming
r109,s6,See more detailed comments in the paragraph below.,non_actionable,other
r109,s7,"While LINE or SDNE, which the authors cite, may not run on some of the larger datasets they can be tested on the smaller datasets.",actionable,fact
r109,s8,"For instance, on page 5 footnote 4 the authors state that DeepWalk and node2vec are tested under similar conditions but do not elaborate.",actionable,shortcoming
r109,s9,For instance a sentence of length 10 with context window 5 gives 6 contexts.,non_actionable,fact
r11,s0,It lacks a few references and important technical aspects are not discussed.,actionable,shortcoming
r11,s1,"Overall, the contribution is modest at best.",non_actionable,fact
r11,s2,"** DETAILED REVIEW ** On mistakes, it is wrong to say that an SVM is a parameterless classifier.",actionable,shortcoming
r11,s3,I think slack variables come from (Cortes et al 95).,non_actionable,fact
r11,s4,Could you explain how classes are predicted given a test problem?,actionable,question
r11,s5,What are the class you are interested in?,actionable,question
r11,s6,since you mention at the end of page 4 that you will only rely on linear SVMs for computational reasons.,non_actionable,fact
r11,s7,"You need to find a better justification for using L2-SVM than ""L2-SVM loss variant is considered to be the best by the author of the paper"", did you try classical SVM and found them performing worse?",actionable,suggestion
r11,s8,"On empirical evaluation, I already mentioned that it impossible to understand what the classification problem on TIMIT is. I suspect it might be speaker identification.",actionable,shortcoming
r11,s9,"Also, most work typically use omniglot as a proof of concept and consider mini-imagenet as a more challenging set.",non_actionable,fact
r110,s0,review: experiments insufficient This paper proposes a neural network architecture around the idea of layered scene composition.,non_actionable,shortcoming
r110,s1,"An encoder is later trained to map real images into the space of latent codes for the generator, allowing the system to be applied to real image segmentation tasks.",non_actionable,fact
r110,s2,"Visualization of learned layers for several scene types (Figures 3, 7) shows that the network does learn a reasonable compositional scene model.",non_actionable,fact
r110,s3,"Experiments evaluate the ability to port the model learned in an unsupervised manner to semantic segmentation tasks, using a limited amount of supervision for the end task.",non_actionable,fact
r110,s4,"Only two scene types (bedroom, kitchen) and four object classes (bed, window, appliance, counter) are used for evaluation.",non_actionable,shortcoming
r110,s5,This is far below the norm for semantic segmentation work in computer vision.,actionable,shortcoming
r110,s6,"Even the ADE20K dataset, from which this paper samples, is substantially larger and has an established benchmarking methodology (see http://placeschallenge.csail.mit.edu/).",non_actionable,fact

r110,s8,"Only simple baselines (eg autoencoder, kmeans) implemented by this paper are included.",actionable,shortcoming
r110,s9,"In summary, the proposed method may be promising, but far more experiments are needed.",actionable,suggestion

r111,s1,I understand the difference between [Kos+17] and the proposed scheme but I could not understand in which situation the proposed scheme works better.,actionable,shortcoming
r111,s2,"From the adversary's standpoint, it would be easier to manipulate inputs than latent variables.",actionable,suggestion
r111,s3,"On the other hand, I agree that sample-independent perturbation is much more practical than sample-dependent perturbation.",non_actionable,agreement
r111,s4,"In Section 3.1, the attack methods #2 and #3 should be detailed more.",actionable,suggestion
r111,s5,I could not imagine how VAE and T are trained simultaneously.,actionable,fact

r112,s1,This paper addresses complex dynamical systems modelling through nonparametric Partial Differential Equations using neural architectures.,non_actionable,fact
r112,s2,The most important idea of the papier (PDE-net) is to learn both differential operators and the function that governs the PDE.,non_actionable,fact
r112,s3,"To achieve this goal, the approach relies on the approximation of differential operators by convolution of filters of appropriate order.",non_actionable,fact
r112,s4,This is really the strongest point of the paper.,non_actionable,agreement
r112,s5,"Moreover, a basic system called delta t block implements one level of full approximation and is stoked several times.",non_actionable,fact
r112,s6,"Comments: The paper is badly structured and is sometimes hard to read because it does not present in a linear way the classic ingredients of Machine Learning, expression of the full function to be estimated, equations of each layer, description of the set of parameters to be learned and the loss function.",actionable,shortcoming
r112,s7,"About the loss function, I was surprised not to see a sparsity constraint on the different filters in order to select the order of the differential operators themselves.",actionable,shortcoming
r112,s8,I also found difficult to measure the degree of novelty of the approach considering the recent works and  the related work section should have been much more precise in terms of comparison.,actionable,shortcoming
r112,s9,"Finally, I’ve found the paper very interesting and promising but regarding the standard of scientific publication, it requires additional attention to provide a better description the model and discuss the learning scheme to get a strongest and reproducible approach.",actionable,suggestion
r113,s0,"Lack of convincing motivation and results not particularly unimpressive This paper proposes to train a classifier neural network not just to classifier, but also to reconstruct a representation of its input, in order to factorize the class information from the appearance (or ""style"" as used in this paper).",non_actionable,shortcoming
r113,s1,This is done by first using unsupervised pretraining and then fine-tuning using a weighted combination of the regular multinomial NLL loss and a reconstruction loss at the last hidden layer.,non_actionable,fact
r113,s2,Experiments on MNIST are provided to analyse what this approach learns.,non_actionable,fact
r113,s3,Why is it important to separate class from style?,actionable,question
r113,s4,I don't find the reconstructions demonstrated particularly compelling (they are generally pretty different from the original input).,actionable,shortcoming
r113,s5,"Also, that the ""style"" representation contain less (and I'd say slightly less, in Figure 7 b and d, we still see a lot of same class nearest neighbors) is not exactly a surprising result.",non_actionable,shortcoming
r113,s6,"And the results of figure 9, showing poor reconstructions when changing the class representation essentially demonstrates that the method isn't able to factorize class and style successfully.",non_actionable,shortcoming
r113,s7,"The interpolation results of Figure 11 are also underwhelming, though possibly mostly because the reconstructions are in general not great.",non_actionable,shortcoming
r113,s8,"But most importantly, none of these results are measured in a quantitative way: they are all qualitative, and thus subjective.",non_actionable,shortcoming

r114,s0,The manuscript mainly presents a cheap pruning algorithm for dense layers of DNNs.,non_actionable,fact

r114,s3,The manuscript mainly presents a cheap pruning algorithm for dense layers of DNNs.,non_actionable,fact
r114,s4,"The proposed algorithm is an improvement of Net-Trim (Aghasi et al., 2016), which is to enforce the weights to be sparse.",non_actionable,fact
r114,s5,"The complexity of the proposed algorithm is much lower than Net-Trim and its fast version LOBS (Dong et al., 2017).",non_actionable,fact

r95,s1,"After reading the paper, it’s not clear to me what the components of the model are, what each of them take as input and produce as output, what these modules do and how they are combined.",actionable,shortcoming
r95,s2,— Is the “fork” module the main contribution of the paper?,actionable,question
r95,s3,"So, if no fork module is required for a question, the model architecture is effectively same as IEP?",actionable,question
r95,s4,— Machine accuracy is already par with human accuracy on CLEVR and very close to 100%.,non_actionable,fact
r95,s5,Why is this problem still important?,actionable,question
r95,s6,"They are both trained on the same training data, only test data is of different length and ideally both models should achieve similar accuracy for the first 10 subproblems (same trend as DDRstack).",non_actionable,fact
r95,s7,— Can the authors provide training time comparison of their model and other/baseline models?,actionable,question
r95,s8,These names have not being defined formally in the paper.,actionable,shortcoming
r95,s9,"By proper restructuring of paper and adding more details, the paper can be converted to a solid submission.",actionable,suggestion
r96,s0,The authors perform an analysis of the performance of ResNets and DenseNets under data scarcity constraints and noisy training samples.,non_actionable,fact
r96,s1,The presentation of the paper could be significantly improved.,actionable,shortcoming
r96,s2,The motivation is difficult to grasp and the contributions do not seem compelling.,actionable,shortcoming
r96,s3,"[a] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05027.pdf Moreover, the literature review is very limited.",actionable,shortcoming
r96,s4,"Although there is a vast existing literature on ResNets, DenseNets and, more generally, skip connections, the paper only references 4 papers.",actionable,shortcoming
r96,s5,"Many relevant papers could be referenced in the introduction as examples of successes in computer vision tasks,  identity mapping initialization, recent interpretations of ResNets/DensetNets, etc.",actionable,suggestion
r96,s6,"The title suggests that the analysis is performed on DenseNet architectures, but experiments focus on comparing both ResNets and DenseNets to sequential convolutional networks and assessing the importance of skip connections.",actionable,shortcoming
r96,s7,"(1st paragraph) proposes adding noise to groundtruth labels; however, in section 3.1.2,.",non_actionable,fact
r96,s8,Wouldn’t the noise added to the groundtruth act as a regularizer?,actionable,question
r96,s9,"However, experiments are performed on MNIST, CIFAR100, a curve fitting problem and a presumably synthetic 2D classification problem.",non_actionable,fact
r97,s0,A new method for weight quantization.,non_actionable,fact
r97,s1,"A step in the right direction, with interesting results, but not a huge level of novelty.",non_actionable,fact
r97,s2,"This paper proposes a new method to train DNNs with quantized weights, by including the quantization as a constraint in a proximal quasi-Newton algorithm, which simultaneously learns a scaling for the quantized values (possibly different for positive and negative weights).",non_actionable,fact
r97,s3,"The paper is very clearly written, and the proposal is very well placed in the context of previous methods for the same purpose.",non_actionable,agreement
r97,s4,The experiments are very clearly presented and solidly designed.,non_actionable,agreement
r97,s5,"In fact, the paper is a somewhat simple extension of the method proposed by Hou, Yao, and Kwok (2017), which is where the novelty resides.",non_actionable,fact
r97,s6,"Consequently, there is not a great degree of novelty in terms of the proposed method, and the results are only slightly better than those of previous methods.",non_actionable,shortcoming
r97,s7,"Finally, in terms of analysis of the algorithm, the authors simply invoke a theorem from Hou, Yao, and Kwok (2017), which claims convergence of the proposed algorithm.",non_actionable,fact
r97,s8,"However, what is shown in that paper is that the sequence of loss function values converges, which does not imply that the sequence of weight estimates also converges, because of the presence of a non-convex constraint ($b_j^t \in Q^{n_l}$).",non_actionable,shortcoming
r97,s9,"This may not be relevant for the practical results, but to be accurate, it can't be simply stated that the algorithm converges, without a more careful analysis.",actionable,shortcoming
r98,s0,"Simple yet effective work The authors proposed to compress word embeddings by approximate matrix factorization, and to solve the problem with the Gumbel-soft trick.",non_actionable,agreement
r98,s1,"The proposed method achieved compression rate 98% in a sentiment analysis task, and compression rate over 94% in machine translation tasks, without a performance loss.",non_actionable,fact
r98,s2,This paper is well-written and easy to follow.,non_actionable,agreement
r98,s3,The motivation is clear and the idea is simple and effective.,non_actionable,agreement
r98,s4,It would be better to provide deeper analysis in Subsection 6.1.,actionable,suggestion
r98,s5,The current analysis is too simple.,actionable,shortcoming
r98,s6,It may be interesting to explain the meanings of individual components.,actionable,suggestion
r98,s7,Does each component is related to a certain topic?,actionable,question
r98,s8,Is it meaningful to perform ADD or SUBSTRACT on the leaned code?,actionable,question
r98,s9,"It may also be interesting to provide suitable theoretical analysis, e.g., relationships with the SVD of the embedding matrix.",actionable,suggestion
r99,s0,Focus on the success This paper focuses on using RNNs to generate straightline computer programs (ie. code strings) using reinforcement learning.,non_actionable,fact
r99,s1,"The basic setup assumes a setting where we do not have access to input/output samples, but instead only have access to a separate reward function for each desired program that indicates how close a predicted program is to the correct one.",non_actionable,fact
r99,s2,This reward function is used to train a separate RNN for each desired program.,non_actionable,fact
r99,s3,"This is a nice result, but I did not feel as though their algorithm was sufficently different from the algorithm used by Liang et.",actionable,shortcoming
r99,s4,I was not able to imagine a reasonable setting where we would have access to a reward function of this form without input/output examples.,actionable,shortcoming
r99,s5,"I feel as though the restriction to the reward function in this case makes the problem uncessarily hard, and does not represent an important use-case.",actionable,shortcoming
r99,s6,"1.  At the end of section 4.3 the paper is inconsistent about whether the test cases are randomly generated or hand picked, and whether they use 5 test cases for all problems, or sometimes up to 20 test cases.",actionable,shortcoming
r99,s7,"If they are hand picked (and the number of test cases is hand chosen for each problem), then how dependant are the results on an appropriate choice of test cases?",actionable,question
r99,s8,"2.  They argue that they don't need to separate train and test, but I think it is important to be sure that the generated programs work on test cases that are not a part of the reward function.",actionable,suggestion
r99,s9,"They say that ""almost always"" the synthesizer does not overfit, but I would have liked them to be clear about whether their reported results include any cases of overfitting (i.e. did they ensure they the final generate program always generalized)?",actionable,question
